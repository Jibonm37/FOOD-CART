            <p>
                I began working in restaurants at the age of sixteen, washing dishes in a steakhouse at our local strip mall, then somehow, ending up at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, working with Alice Waters and co-owner, Executive Pastry Chef Lindsey Shere, who I consider my pastry mentor. I spent thirteen years in the kitchens at Chez Panisse before leaving in 1999. During my time in San Francisco, I was also a line cook at Zuni Caf√© and the pastry chef at several other San Francisco restaurants.

            <div class="item-about"><p> In cuisine, an omelette or omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg). It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), or some combination of the above.

            <div class="item-about"><p> Pudding is a type of food that can be either a dessert or a savory (salty or spicy) dish that is part of the main meal. ...
